## Pre Proposal
Name of Project: RunDiary

Brief Proposal: (The problem you are trying to solve and how you plan to solve it ) 
`An app to track training runs and races. Entries can contain diary-style information and will be displayed to users in a calendar format.`

## Final Proposal (After you get the üëç on your pre proposal)

Overview of app: 
`An app to track training runs and races. Entries can contain diary-style information and will be displayed to users in a calendar format.`

## Initial ERD

## MVP Definition
1. User-specific CRUD for runs completed
1. User-specific calendar view of completed runs
1. Add user-specific future events as ‚Äúraces‚Äù
Dream Stretch Goals:
1. Display races differently than training runs
1. Ability to upload photos for each run
1. Other crap you might not get around to

## User Stories (can be integrated into MVP def)
* As a runner, in order to track my training, I want to keep a diary of my runs.
* As a runner, in order to keep track of each run, I want to save data about date, place, distance, time to complete run, photo, and a "diary entry" about what happened and how I felt.
* As a runner, in order to visualize my data, I want to be able to view past runs and future scheduled runs on a calendar.
* As a runner, in order to keep track of my goals, I want to specify certain future events as "races."
* As a runner, in order to review, edit, or delete runs that may have already been entered, I want to click the name of the run on the calendar and see the enter/edit run page with previously entered data pre-populated in the fields. From there I can change data and save the entry, delete the entry, or close the entry without making any changes.

## Planning Links (Start on it before one-on-one but doesn‚Äôt have to be fully fleshed out)
* ERD - include with your README.md
* Link to Repo with tickets
* Wireframes or Link to Moqup - include with your README.md
* Plan/outline the components your project will need showing the data relationship (props and state). Add to your README.md.
