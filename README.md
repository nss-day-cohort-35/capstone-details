# Capstone Time - Getting Started

1. Your capstone is a single page app created with React.
1. Share your idea with Brenda and get `thumbs-up`
1. Once you complete your proposal, you will meet with an instruction team member to confirm your **realistic MVP**.

    * Capstone Final Proposals DUE (EOD) - October 17, 2019

           * Your Goals
         * Describe any technology needed.
         * List any API's you will be using (an API is not necessary).
